E-commerce Application with Appwrite Authentication
This project is a React-based E-commerce Application that incorporates Appwrite Authentication for secure user management. The goal is to provide a fully functional e-commerce platform where users can browse products, add them to a cart, and place orders, with authentication seamlessly managed through Appwrite.

The authentication system from the Expertizo project is utilized, offering features like user registration, login, logout, and session management. By leveraging Appwrite's robust backend capabilities, the project ensures scalability and security.

How Authentication Works
The authentication system is powered by Appwrite:

The Account service handles user registration, login, and session persistence.
Authentication is tied to secure routes in the app, ensuring only authenticated users can access their cart or place orders.
Token-based session management is implemented for API security.
